Files for Homework 1, Computer Vision


This contains starter code for the Computer Vision Homework. Read the instructions on what to do in the Google Doc linked in Moodle. You may either write your report in this document, or include a separate report.

**Contents:**
- Pedestrians: A folder containing two subfolders. Each subfolder contains 10 images, one set with pedestrians, and one without, for testing
- findPedestrians.py: a starter file for the second task of the homework

**You will want to copy the BallPics&Video folder from the activity project to this one: I am not including it here because you don't need to download the videos twice!**
